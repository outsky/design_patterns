SUMMARY
=======
Implement `strategy pattern` by an example.

Strategy
========
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

EXAMPLE
=======
The example reads a string inputed by user, and then process the string according to the user's choice.
The algorithms user can choose are:
* to uppercase
* to lowercase
* remove white spaces
* odd words to uppercase and even words to lowercase
